- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - linting
- [Document This](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joelday.docthis) - automatically generate JS Docs off of function params
- [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) - makes brackets different colors so that you can easily match them
- [Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) - adds different colors for different levels of indenting (easy to track deeply nested functions)
- [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) - automatically renames closing tag when you change the starting tag
- [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify) - even though it has some conflicts with ESLint, for the most part it works. Especially useful if you're pasting in a bunch of unformatted code or trying to refactor code that doesn't fit ESLint standard at all. Not a magic bullet though

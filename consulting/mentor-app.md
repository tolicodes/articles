Dear Thinkful,

My name is Toli, but online I go by @tolicodes. I consider many things important to being a stellar developer - keeping up with the latest technologies, making open source contributions, going to meetups and conferences. But one of the most important aspects in mentorship.

  

Sometimes as senior developers, we get stuck in a certain way of thinking. After doing something for 10+ years one way, we cannot even comprehend what it’s like to approach a project or library as a junior developer. But junior developers bring something invaluable to the table - a fresh perspective.

  

I have been a mentor to many junior and mid level developers, officially and unofficially. And every time, I have learned something new by being forced to explain something that I had done for years. It truly is a large part of how I grow, and improve my own style.

  

The best example of my mentoring experience is my [CodeMentor profile](https://www.codementor.io/tolicodes) where I have mentored hundreds of programmers on data visualization and frontend development. My reviews and ratings speak for themseleves. I have also advised dozens of startups on proper product development methodology. Just look through my [LinkedIn Recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tolicodes/). When I was in New York I also volunteered for [ScriptEd](https://scripted.org/our-team/volunteers/), which taught highschool kids web development.

  

If you want to get a better idea of what I’m like, check out my website, tolicodes.com. Or check out my latest open source contribution, picklejs.com

  

I hope to hear from you soon, and become a part of the Thinkful mentoring family,

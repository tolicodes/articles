# Experience 

Hello,
I've had over 10 years experience in development at this point, working on everything from jQuery to Vue to React. I've seen a lot of good/bad architectures, and know exactly which pitfalls to avoid. 

I've worked with dozens of companies (see my website, tolicodes.com), big and small, including Amex, Federal Reserve, and WSJ.

# Experience - LT 90
I've had over 10 years experience in development at this point, working on everything from jQuery to Vue to React. I've seen a lot of good/bad architectures, and know exactly which pitfalls to avoid, which is why my hourly rate is higher than you expected (note it's 90/h, CM interface doesn't allow putting more than the maximum rate). 

# React Native
I'm not going to lie, I have just started working with React Native ~6 mo ago extensively, which is much less than other candidates. However, I've been developing 2 applications for clients since then, one called HomeScore (allowing users to find homes) and another WeAcro (allowing users to find acro yoga poses).

I have 4 years experience in React, and over 10 years programming in general, and most of the knowledge is transferable. 

Also I'm giving a 30% discount off my regular 90/h rate since it's still a technology I'm developing my skills in.
